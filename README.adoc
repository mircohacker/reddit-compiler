= NOT WORKING ANY MORE

The tool was based on the reddit API which was shut down. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy

= Reddit serial compiler

This repo contains the code to compile multiple reddit (text) posts into one `epub` file.
This can be used to read a serial on a device of your choice.
For example an ebook reader.

== Project structure

The `frontend` directory contains a react app that allows users the creation of their epub.
This frontend will be deployed to github pages.

The `backend`  directory contains a Python FastAPI project which implements the logic to get the reddit posts and stitch them together in order to form an epub.
This API will be hosted in an AWS Lambda function.
